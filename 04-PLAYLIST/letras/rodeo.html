        <br> Daytrip took it to 10 (hey)

    </p>
    <p>
        <br> Oh here we go, please let me know
        <br> Off we go, don't leave me in the cold

    </p>
    <p>
        <br> If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
        <br> If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
        <br> If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
        <br> I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought
        <br> I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you're upset
        <br> I'ma call you later on, baby girl, don't you forget
        <br> I'ma take you from this party, we might go and have some sex
        <br> Or we do that later on, now we lit like cigarettes
    </p>
    <p>
        <br> I thought you would stay with me
        <br> I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
        <br> So what I'm gon' do?
        <br> I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Oh here we go, please let me know

        <br>If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
        <br>If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
        <br>I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought (Cardi)

    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Look, gunshot, gunshot
        <br>Thought you heard about me, must not, must not
        <br>Last nigga did me dirty, dirty
        <br>Like a bathroom in a truck stop, truck stop
        <br>Now my heart, it feels like Brillo, I'm hard like armadillo
        <br>Can't be no nigga ex, I could only be his widow
        <br>That's a fact, dressed in black, my heart break, bones will crack
        <br>I be chilling, watching Oxygen, my favorite show is "Snapped" ("Snapped", "Snapped")
        <br>Now you know how I get, every day, a foreign whip
        <br>Rather see you in a hearse than see you with some other bitch
        <br>Huh?
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Oh here we go, please let me know
        <br>Off we go, don't leave me in the cold

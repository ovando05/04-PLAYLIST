        <br> She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
        <br> She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
        <br> Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
        <br> I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin' down
        <br> I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
        <br> She tryna get out of the mix
        <br> Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit

        <br>You know I'm supportin' this shit
        <br>We used to do pornos when you would come over but now you got morals and shit
        <br>I got like four on the wrist and an adorable kid

        <br> Her daddy is not around, mama is definitely not around
        <br> She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
        <br> Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
        <br> Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
        <br> I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
        <br> Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
        <br> Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
        <br> You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight

        <br>That's the motto (mm-mm)
        <br>Throw it back with no chaser, with no trouble (mm-mm)
        <br>Poppin' that MoÃ«t, baby, let's make some bubbles (mm-mm)
        <br>Puffin' on that gelato, wanna be seein' double
        <br>Gotta do what you gotta
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Believe it
        <br>We ain't got no plans to leave here
        <br>Tell all of your friends to be here
        <br>We ain't gonna sleep all weekend

    </p>
    <p>
        <br> Oh, you know, you know, you know that's the motto (mm-mm)
        <br> Drop a few bills then pop a few champagne bottles (mm-mm)
        <br> Throwin' that money like you just won the lotto (mm-mm)
        <br> We been up all damn summer makin' that bread and butter
        <br> Tell me, did I just stutter?

        <br>Hopped in the Range, can't feel my face, the window's down (down, down, down)
        <br>Back to my place, my birthday cake is coming out
        <br>The way it's hittin' like I could go all night
        <br>Don't want no bloodshot eyes, so hold my drink, let's fly
    </p>
